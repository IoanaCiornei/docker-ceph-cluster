		will be used for configuration purposes.

		NUM_OSD - number of hosts that will run OSD daemons
		NUM_MON - number of hosts that will be monitors
		NUM_DISKS -  number of disks per OSD host

		LOOP_MAJOR - should be fixed at 7
		START_MINOR - first minor that is not used for loop devices

		NETWORK_IP - shoould be set to a local unused network
		NETWORK_MASK - mask for the cluster network
		CLUSTER_NETWORK - name of the network cluster

		USER - user with sudo rights on all the Docker containers
