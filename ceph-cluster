Usage:
	ceph-cluster [create|start|stop|delete|restart]

		create - builds the Docker base image, starts the containers, install ceph on all the nodes
			and creates the initial configuration of the cluster
		stop   - shutdowns all the container without deleting their contents
		start  - starts all the cluste nodes previously stopped
		delete - deletes a cluster, all its nodes and any images that existed
		restart - it does what it says

Description:
	ceph-cluster users create a Ceph Cluster hosted entirely on a single machine.
	Cluster nodes are Docker containers that run a full init system, a ssh server and have
	full connectivity between them.
